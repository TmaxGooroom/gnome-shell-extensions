"description": "An icon taskbar for the Gnome Shell. This extension moves the dash into the gnome main panel so that the application launchers and system tray are combined into a single     panel, similar to that found in KDE Plasma and Windows 7+. A separate dock is no longer needed for easy access to running and favorited applications.\n\nFor a more traditional experien    ce, you may also want to use Tweak Tool to enable Windows > Titlebar Buttons > Minimize & Maximize.\n\nFor the best support, please report any issues on Github. Dash-to-panel is develop    ed and maintained by @jderose9 and @charlesg99.",
