Description: Extensions to extend functionality of GNOME Shell
 The GNOME Shell redefines user interactions with the GNOME desktop. In
 particular, it offers new paradigms for launching applications,
 accessing documents, and organizing open windows in GNOME. Later, it
 will introduce a new applets eco-system and offer new solutions for
 other desktop features, such as notifications and contacts management.
 The GNOME Shell is intended to replace functions handled by the GNOME
 Panel and by the window manager in previous versions of GNOME. The GNOME
 Shell has rich visual effects enabled by new graphical technologies.
 .
 GNOME Shell is extensible using extensions. This package contains
 official GNOME Shell extensions.
